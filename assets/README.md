# Placeholder assets - these will be replaced with proper icons later

This directory contains placeholder assets for the Expo app.
The following files are referenced in app.json but not yet created:

- icon.png (app icon)
- splash.png (splash screen)
- adaptive-icon.png (Android adaptive icon)
- favicon.png (web favicon)

For development, we can use simple placeholder files or update app.json to not require them.
