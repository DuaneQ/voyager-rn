## ✅ Recent Simplification: Firebase Web SDK Authentication (Jan 2025)

**Architecture Change:** Migrated from REST API + custom tokens to Firebase Web SDK

**Benefits:**
- Direct Firebase Web SDK integration (v12.5.0 works with RN 0.81.5)
- Eliminated 765+ lines of complex REST API code
- Removed custom token generation dependency
- Authentication flow now matches PWA exactly
- Profile loading properly separated from sign-in flow

**Documentation:** See [docs/auth/SIMPLE_AUTH_FLOW.md](docs/auth/SIMPLE_AUTH_FLOW.md) for migration details

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (you can use the global CLI or the local binary: `npm install -g expo-cli` or use `npx expo start`)
- Xcode (for iOS simulator) — install from the Mac App Store
- Android Studio / Android Emulator (for Android development)
- For Firebase Auth persistence on React Native install `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd voyager-RN
npm install
```

2. **Verify Firebase connection:**
```bash
node test-database.js
```

3. **Start development server:**
```bash
npm start
# or
expo start
```

4. **Run on specific platforms:**
```bash
# Start Expo dev server
npm start

# Launch directly (builds and runs)
npm run start:ios       # iOS simulator
npm run start:android   # Android emulator
npm run start:web       # Web browser
```

## 📚 Complete Scripts Documentation

For comprehensive guide to all available scripts including testing, CI/CD, and troubleshooting:

**See: [docs/SCRIPTS_GUIDE.md](docs/SCRIPTS_GUIDE.md)**

Quick command reference:
```bash
# Development
npm start                    # Start dev server
npm run start:ios            # Launch iOS

# Unit Tests
npm test                     # Run once
npm run test:watch           # Watch mode

# E2E Tests
npm run e2e:ios              # iOS (headed)
npm run e2e:android          # Android (headed)
npm run e2e:all:headless     # Both platforms (CI/CD)
npm run e2e:all:headless:3x  # Stability validation
```

## 🚀 Cloud Functions Deployment

When deploying Firebase Cloud Functions, use the pinned `firebase-tools` version from package.json to avoid supply-chain attacks:

```bash
# Deploy specific function to dev
cd /path/to/voyager-pwa
npx firebase-tools@14.25.1 deploy --only functions:generateFullItinerary --project mundo1-dev

# Deploy multiple functions
npx firebase-tools@14.25.1 deploy --only functions:generateFullItinerary,functions:verifyPlaces --project mundo1-dev

# Deploy all functions
npx firebase-tools@14.25.1 deploy --only functions --project mundo1-dev
```

**Security Note:** Always use a pinned version (not `@latest`) to prevent supply-chain attacks. Update the version in both `package.json` and this README when upgrading.

**Note:** If you encounter "Error generating the service identity for pubsub/eventarc", run:
```bash
gcloud beta services identity create --service=pubsub.googleapis.com --project=mundo1-dev
gcloud beta services identity create --service=eventarc.googleapis.com --project=mundo1-dev
```

### Development Environment Setup

1. **iOS Development:**
   - Install Xcode from the App Store
   - Open Xcode once and accept the license prompts
   - Open the Simulator app (Xcode → Open Developer Tool → Simulator) and boot a device (or use `open -a Simulator`)
   - To run the app from your project root:
     ```bash
     npm run ios
     # or
     npx expo start --ios
     ```
   
   **Testing Release Builds on Simulator (iPhone 17 Pro):**
   ```bash
   # Shutdown all simulators first
   xcrun simctl shutdown all
   
   # Boot iPhone 17 Pro simulator
   xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 17 Pro"
   open -a Simulator
   
   # Build release configuration
   cd ios
   xcodebuild -workspace TravalPass.xcworkspace \
     -scheme TravalPass \
     -configuration Release \
     -sdk iphonesimulator \
     -destination 'name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
     -derivedDataPath ./build
   
   # Install and launch
   SIMULATOR_ID=$(xcrun simctl list devices | grep "iPhone 17 Pro" | grep "Booted" | grep -oE '\([A-F0-9-]+\)' | tr -d '()')
   xcrun simctl install $SIMULATOR_ID ./build/Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator/TravalPass.app
   xcrun simctl launch $SIMULATOR_ID com.travalpass.app
   cd ..
   ```
   
   **Why xcodebuild instead of `npx expo run:ios --configuration Release`?**  
   Expo detects physical iOS devices even when simulators are booted, causing "No code signing certificates" errors. Using xcodebuild directly targets the simulator explicitly.

2. **Android Development:**
    - Install Android Studio and open SDK Manager
    - Ensure you have installed at least one SDK Platform (API 33+) and the following SDK Tools: Android SDK Platform-Tools, Android Emulator, Command-line Tools
    - Create an Android Virtual Device (AVD) in Device Manager (Tools → Device Manager)
    - Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` (adjust if your SDK path differs):
       ```bash
       export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
       export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/emulator:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/latest/bin"
       ```
    - Reload your shell and verify:
       ```bash
       source ~/.zshrc
       adb --version
       emulator -list-avds
       ```
    - Boot an AVD from Android Studio Device Manager or run:
       ```bash
       emulator -avd <AVD_NAME>
       npm run android
       ```

3. **Physical Device Testing:**
   - Install Expo Go app on your device
   - Scan QR code from `expo start` command

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project improves upon the original PWA architecture by implementing clean code principles and better separation of concerns.

### Directory Structure

## Troubleshooting: "No Android connected device found" error

If you see an error like:

```
CommandError: No Android connected device found, and no emulators could be started automatically.
Please connect a device or create an emulator (https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator).
Then follow the instructions here to enable USB debugging:
https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html#developer-device-options. If you are using Genymotion go to Settings -> ADB, select "Use custom Android SDK tools", and point it at your Android SDK directory.
```

Follow these steps to resolve it (macOS / zsh):

1. Verify Android SDK and platform-tools are installed and on your PATH

    - Confirm SDK location (default on macOS):

       ```bash
       ls "$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
       ```

    - Add these to your `~/.zshrc` (adjust if SDK path differs):

       ```bash
       export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
       export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/emulator:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/latest/bin"
       ```

    - Reload your shell:

       ```bash
       source ~/.zshrc
       ```

    - Verify `adb` and emulator are available:

       ```bash
       adb --version
       emulator -list-avds
       ```

2. Create or start an Android Virtual Device (AVD)

    - Open Android Studio → Device Manager → Create Virtual Device (choose a phone and API level).
    - After creating an AVD you can start it from Device Manager or via CLI:

       ```bash
       emulator -avd <AVD_NAME>
       ```

    - Once started, you can run the app with Expo (this will attempt to open the emulator if needed):

       ```bash
       npm run android
       # or via expo directly
       npx expo start --android
       ```

3. Using a physical Android device (enable USB debugging)

    - On the Android device: Settings → About phone → tap "Build number" 7 times to enable Developer options.
    - Settings → System → Developer options → enable "USB debugging".
    - Connect the device via USB, then on macOS run:

       ```bash
       adb devices
       ```

       You should see your device listed. If it says "unauthorized", accept the debug prompt on the phone.

4. Genymotion users

    - Genymotion uses its own virtual devices. To make Genymotion work with `adb`:
       - Open Genymotion → Settings → ADB
       - Select "Use custom Android SDK tools" and point to your Android SDK folder (e.g. `$HOME/Library/Android/sdk`).
       - Restart Genymotion and run your Genymotion VM. Run `adb devices` to confirm it's visible.

5. Common troubleshooting commands

    ```bash
    # Restart adb server
    adb kill-server && adb start-server

    # List connected devices
    adb devices -l

    # Show running emulators
    emulator -list-avds

    # Start a specific AVD by name
    emulator -avd <AVD_NAME>
    ```

6. Additional tips

    - Ensure virtualization is enabled in BIOS/firmware. On macOS use Hypervisor.framework or Intel HAXM (older machines).
    - If Expo still cannot launch an emulator automatically, start the AVD yourself first and then run `npm run android` or `npx expo start --android`.
    - Accept Android SDK licenses via:

       ```bash
       yes | sdkmanager --licenses
       ```

    - If you installed Android Studio after opening a terminal, restart the terminal so PATH updates take effect.

### Key Architecture Principles

#### S.O.L.I.D Principles Implementation

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Screens only handle UI composition and navigation
   - Services handle specific business logic
   - Repositories handle data persistence
   - Components focus solely on UI rendering

2. **Open/Closed Principle**
   - Service interfaces allow extension without modification
   - Repository pattern enables new data sources
   - Component composition over inheritance

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**
   - All service implementations are interchangeable
   - Repository implementations use consistent interfaces

4. **Interface Segregation Principle**
   - Small, focused interfaces over large ones
   - Separate models for different concerns

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**
   - Screens depend on service abstractions
   - Services depend on repository interfaces
   - No direct external dependencies in UI layer

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Running the App

```bash
# Start development server with full options
expo start

# Quick platform starts
npm run ios        # Start iOS simulator
npm run android    # Start Android emulator
npm run web        # Start web browser
```

### Production Deployment (EAS Build)

**Prerequisites:**
1. Increment version numbers in `app.json` and `package.json`
   - `version`: e.g., 1.7.0 → 1.7.1
   - iOS `buildNumber`: e.g., 26 → 27
   - Android `versionCode`: e.g., 18 → 19
2. Commit and push all changes to git

**Deploy to iOS App Store (auto-submit):**
```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production --auto-submit
```

**Deploy to Google Play Store (auto-submit):**
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production --auto-submit
```

**Deploy to Both Stores:**
```bash
eas build --platform all --profile production --auto-submit
```

**Manual submission (build only, no auto-submit):**
```bash
# iOS only
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# Android only
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

**⚠️ Important:** Each successful EAS build counts against your quota. Always test locally in Release mode before building:
```bash
# iOS Release mode test
npx expo run:ios --configuration Release

# Android Release mode test
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

### Database Testing

```bash
# Verify Firebase connectivity
node test-database.js

# Simple connection test
node simple-test.js
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# TypeScript type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Linting (when configured)
npx eslint src/

# Format code (when configured)
npx prettier --write src/
```

## 📱 Features

This React Native app replicates all voyager-pwa functionality:

### Core Features
- **User Authentication** - Firebase Auth with email/password and Google Sign-In
- **Travel Matching** - Swipe-based itinerary matching system
- **Real-time Chat** - Messaging between matched travelers
- **Video Feed** - TikTok-style travel video sharing
- **Profile Management** - User profiles with photos and preferences
- **Search & Filters** - Advanced itinerary search with filters

### Technical Features
- **Cross-platform** - iOS, Android, and Web support
- **Offline Support** - AsyncStorage for local data caching
- **Real-time Updates** - Firebase real-time database integration
- **Push Notifications** - ✅ **Working** - Expo push notification system with FCM/APNs ([see docs](docs/push-notifications/))
  - New match notifications
  - Chat message notifications
  - Video comment notifications
  - iOS/Android support (Web excluded)
  - Critical iOS token refresh bug fixed (Feb 15, 2026)
- **Deep Linking** - Custom URL scheme support

## � Push Notifications

**Status**: ✅ **Fully Working** (as of February 15, 2026)

### Overview
TravalPass uses `expo-notifications` with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for cross-platform push notifications:

- **iOS**: APNs tokens automatically converted to FCM format via cloud function
- **Android**: Native FCM tokens
- **Web**: Not supported (intentionally excluded)

### Notification Types
1. **New Match Notifications** - When two travelers mutually like each other's itineraries
2. **Chat Message Notifications** - Real-time alerts for new messages
3. **Video Comment Notifications** - Alerts when someone comments on your video

### Architecture
- **Client**: `NotificationService` class handles permissions, token registration/refresh, and notification display
- **Server**: Firebase Cloud Functions trigger on Firestore events (`onCreate`) to send notifications
- **Token Storage**: FCM tokens stored as array field on user document (`users/{uid}.fcmTokens[]`)

### Recent Critical Fixes (Feb 15, 2026)
- ✅ **iOS Token Refresh Bug** - Fixed overnight notification failures caused by APNs→FCM conversion missing in token refresh listener
- ✅ **Re-registration Loop** - Fixed infinite re-registration by adding `useCallback` memoization
- ✅ **Privacy Violation** - Removed user IDs from production logs
- ✅ **Security Risk** - Deleted debug utility that logged FCM tokens

### Documentation
- **[Push Notification Plan](docs/push-notifications/PUSH_NOTIFICATION_PLAN.md)** - Complete architecture and implementation guide
- **[Recent Fixes (Feb 15, 2026)](docs/push-notifications/NOTIFICATION_FIXES_FEB_15_2026.md)** - Detailed fix documentation
- **[Debugging Guide (Feb 14, 2026)](docs/push-notifications/NOTIFICATION_DEBUGGING_FEB_14_2026.md)** - Original issue investigation
 - **Quick troubleshooting checklist included in the recent fixes document** (see `docs/push-notifications/NOTIFICATION_FIXES_FEB_15_2026.md`)

### Known Issues (Low Priority)
- Badge count hardcoded to 1 (not actual unread count)
- No periodic token cleanup (stale tokens accumulate)
- Missing `collapseKey` on match/video notifications
- Dev/prod Firebase config mismatch potential

See [NOTIFICATION_FIXES_FEB_15_2026.md](docs/push-notifications/NOTIFICATION_FIXES_FEB_15_2026.md) for details.

## �🔄 Migration from Current Structure

The project is designed to gradually migrate from the current structure to the improved architecture:

### Current Issues Being Addressed
1. **Component Duplication** - Removing `*Working.tsx` vs regular component duplication
2. **Mixed Responsibilities** - Separating UI, business logic, and data access
3. **Direct Firebase Calls** - Abstracting through repository pattern
4. **No Service Layer** - Adding proper business logic abstraction
5. **Missing Domain Models** - Creating typed domain models

### Migration Strategy
1. **Extract Services** - Move business logic from components to services
2. **Create Repositories** - Abstract Firebase calls through repository interfaces
3. **Define Domain Models** - Create proper TypeScript models
4. **Refactor Components** - Make components pure UI with no business logic
5. **Implement Dependency Injection** - Use service injection pattern

## 🔗 Integration with voyager-pwa

### Shared Resources
- **Firebase Database** - Identical database structure and configuration
- **Authentication** - Same Firebase Auth setup
- **Data Models** - Compatible interfaces and types
- **Business Logic** - Equivalent functionality and user flows

### Key Differences
- **UI Framework** - React Native vs React web components
- **Navigation** - React Navigation vs React Router
- **Storage** - AsyncStorage vs localStorage
- **Platform APIs** - Native mobile APIs vs web APIs

## 🚀 Deployment

### Development Builds
```bash
# Create development build
expo build:ios --type simulator
expo build:android --type apk
```

### Production Builds
```bash
# iOS App Store
expo build:ios --type archive

# Android Play Store
expo build:android --type app-bundle
```

### Environment Configuration
- **Development** - Uses `mundo1-dev` Firebase project
- **Production** - Uses `mundo1-1` Firebase project
- **Configuration** - Managed in `src/config/firebaseConfig.ts`

## 🧪 Testing

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests** - Fast, mocked tests (Jest with mocks) ✅
- **Integration Tests** - Firebase emulator tests validating matching logic ✅
- **Component Tests** - React Native Testing Library for UI components ✅
- **E2E Tests** - Detox for full end-to-end user flows ✅

### Running Tests Locally
```bash
# Unit tests only (fast, mocked)
npm test

# Integration tests only (requires Firebase emulators)
npm run test:integration

# All tests (unit + integration)
npm run test:all

# E2E tests
npm run e2e:all:headless
```

### Test Status: ✅ ALL PASSING
- **Unit Tests**: 29/29 passing
- **Integration Tests**: 55/55 passing (COMPREHENSIVE - see [docs/COMPREHENSIVE_INTEGRATION_TESTS.md](docs/COMPREHENSIVE_INTEGRATION_TESTS.md))
- **E2E Tests**: Configured and working

### Integration Test Coverage
The integration tests now provide **comprehensive coverage** (55 tests) of ALL matching criteria:
- ✅ **Destination Matching** (2 tests) - exact match required
- ✅ **Date Overlap Logic** (6 tests) - all overlap scenarios
- ✅ **Age Range Filtering** (5 tests) - boundaries + edge cases
- ✅ **Gender Preference** (3 tests) - all options
- ✅ **Status Preference** (2 tests) - all options
- ✅ **Sexual Orientation Preference** (2 tests) - all options
- ✅ **Blocking Logic** (3 tests) - bidirectional blocking
- ✅ **Combined Filters** (2 tests) - multiple criteria together
- ✅ **Edge Cases** (4 tests) - missing fields, boundaries

**Coverage**: ~95% of matching algorithm logic ✅

### CI/CD Testing
Tests run **in parallel** on GitHub Actions for faster feedback:
- **Unit Tests Workflow** (`ci.yml`) - Jest unit tests with coverage (~2-3 min)
- **Integration Tests Workflow** (`integration-tests.yml`) - Firebase emulator tests (~4-6 min)
- Both workflows run simultaneously on PRs and merges

### Critical Integration Tests ✅
