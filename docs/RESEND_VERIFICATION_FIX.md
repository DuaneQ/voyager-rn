# Resend Email Verification Fix

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

The resend email verification was failing with:
```
LOG  📧 Resend verification called - auth.currentUser: false email: undefined
```

**Root Cause**: When users sign up but haven't verified their email yet, the original logic was:
1. User creates account → Firebase creates user
2. Verification email sent
3. **User gets signed out immediately** via `firebaseSignOut(auth)`
4. `onAuthStateChanged` clears `auth.currentUser`
5. When user tries to resend verification → No `auth.currentUser` exists → Function fails

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Preserve Unverified Users in Firebase Auth**

**Changed in `signUp()` function:**
- **REMOVED** the `firebaseSignOut(auth)` call after account creation
- User remains signed in to Firebase Auth but app treats them as unauthenticated
- This preserves `auth.currentUser` for `resendVerification()` to use

### **2. Enhanced `onAuthStateChanged` Logic**

**New behavior:**
- **Verified users**: Full access (`status: 'authenticated'`, `user: firebaseUser`)
- **Unverified users**: Limited access (`status: 'idle'`, `user: null`) but `auth.currentUser` preserved
- **No users**: Complete cleanup

```typescript
if (firebaseUser.emailVerified) {
  // Grant full access
  setUser(firebaseUser);
  setStatus('authenticated');
} else {
  // Keep signed out from app perspective but preserve Firebase auth
  setUser(null);      // App UI shows login/verification screens
  setStatus('idle');  // But auth.currentUser remains for resendVerification
}
```

### **3. Improved `resendVerification()` Logic**

**Enhanced error handling:**
- Better logging to debug auth state
- Check for already verified users
- Specific error messages for different scenarios
- Helpful messages when session expires

**New flow:**
1. Check if `auth.currentUser` exists (now preserved for unverified users)
2. Reload user to get fresh state
3. Check if already verified
4. Send verification email
5. Handle specific Firebase error codes

### **4. Added Helper Functions**

**New `hasUnverifiedUser()` function:**
```typescript
const hasUnverifiedUser = () => {
  return auth.currentUser && !auth.currentUser.emailVerified;
};
```

## 🧪 **How It Works Now**

### **Sign-Up Flow:**
1. User creates account → Firebase user created
2. Verification email sent automatically
3. **User stays signed in to Firebase** (auth.currentUser exists)
4. **App shows verification screen** (user is null, status is idle)
5. User can now resend verification emails successfully

### **Resend Verification Flow:**
1. User clicks "Resend Verification"
2. `auth.currentUser` exists (preserved from sign-up)
3. Email verification sent successfully
4. User receives email and can verify

### **After Email Verification:**
1. User clicks verification link
2. `onAuthStateChanged` fires with `emailVerified: true`
3. User gets full app access (`status: 'authenticated'`)

## 🎯 **Key Changes Made**

1. **AuthContext.tsx** - `signUp()`: Removed `firebaseSignOut()` call
2. **AuthContext.tsx** - `onAuthStateChanged`: Preserve Firebase auth for unverified users
3. **AuthContext.tsx** - `resendVerification()`: Enhanced error handling and logging
4. **AuthContext.tsx** - Added `hasUnverifiedUser()` helper function

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

1. **Create new account** → Should see verification prompt
2. **Try resend verification** → Should work without "No user logged in" error  
3. **Check console logs** → Should see `auth.currentUser: true` for resend attempts
4. **Verify email** → Should get full app access

The fix preserves the Firebase auth session while keeping the app's security model intact - unverified users can't access the main app but can still resend verification emails.
