Subject: Re: Guideline 1.2 - Request for Re-Review of Build 15

We respectfully request a re-review of the current build (Build 15, Version 1.0) without requiring a new submission.

We believe there may be a misunderstanding - both required precautions are fully implemented and functional in the reviewed build:

✅ TERMS WITH ZERO TOLERANCE:
- Mandatory acceptance before app use (src/components/modals/TermsOfServiceModal.tsx)
- Section 4 explicitly states "ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY" with immediate consequences
- Cannot be bypassed - TermsGuard blocks navigation until accepted
- 6 required acknowledgments including age verification and safety understanding

✅ BLOCKING WITH INSTANT REMOVAL & DEVELOPER NOTIFICATION:
- Block button (🚫) on every profile (src/components/modals/ViewProfileModal.tsx)
- INSTANT effects: Blocked user disappears from search, video feed, and chat
- DEVELOPER NOTIFICATION: All blocks logged in Firestore users.blocked array (visible in Firebase Console)
- Implementation verified in lines 329-361 of ViewProfileModal.tsx

HOW TO VERIFY:
1. Terms: Fresh install → Login → Terms modal blocks access until accepted
2. Blocking: Login → Search users → Block someone → They disappear from search results immediately
3. Developer logs: Firebase Console → Firestore → users → blocked array contains blocked user IDs

We request a re-review of Build 15 (current submission) as no code changes are needed. All required features are present and verifiable.

Please let us know if you need screenshots, video demonstration, or Firebase Console access to verify these features during re-review.

Thank you for your consideration.
