# Daily Activities Display Fix

## Issue
Daily activities were showing in the PWA but not in the React Native app for newly generated itineraries.

## Root Causes

### 1. Incorrect Data Extraction Path
The RN `AIItineraryDisplay` component was reading `dailyPlans` from the wrong data paths. It was checking:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Wrong)
const dailyPlans = parsedData?.daily_itinerary || parsedData?.dailyPlans || (itinerary as any)?.dailyPlans;
```

However, the actual data structure saved by `useAIGeneration` is:
```
itinerary
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ response
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ itinerary
              ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ days: []           // NEW: Array of daily plans
              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dailyPlans: []     // ALSO: Duplicate array (both exist)
```

The PWA correctly checks both paths:
```typescript
// PWA (Correct)
const sourceData = itineraryData; // Already points to response.data.itinerary
return sourceData?.days || sourceData?.dailyPlans || [];
```

### 2. Missing Daily Activities Section in Render
**The RN component was completely missing the Daily Activities rendering code!** It had sections for:
- ‚úÖ Flight Options
- ‚úÖ Travel Recommendations
- ‚úÖ Accommodation Recommendations
- ‚úÖ Alternative Activities
- ‚úÖ Alternative Restaurants
- ‚ùå **Daily Activities** ‚Üê MISSING!

Even after extracting the `dailyPlans` data correctly, there was no code to actually display it.

## Solution

### Fix 1: Correct Data Extraction
Updated RN component to match PWA's data extraction pattern:

```typescript
// AFTER (Correct)
const itineraryData = itinerary?.response?.data?.itinerary;
const dailyPlans = itineraryData?.days || itineraryData?.dailyPlans || parsedData?.daily_itinerary || parsedData?.dailyPlans || (itinerary as any)?.dailyPlans;
```

#### Priority Order (Matching PWA)
1. ‚úÖ `response.data.itinerary.days` (Primary - new structure)
2. ‚úÖ `response.data.itinerary.dailyPlans` (Secondary - also saved)
3. ‚úÖ `parsedData.daily_itinerary` (Fallback - parsed assistant JSON)
4. ‚úÖ `parsedData.dailyPlans` (Fallback)
5. ‚úÖ Top-level `dailyPlans` (Legacy structure)

### Fix 2: Add Daily Activities Section
Added complete Daily Activities accordion section (108 lines) with:

```typescript
{/* Daily Activities Accordion */}
{dailyPlans && dailyPlans.length > 0 && (
  <View style={styles.accordionContainer}>
    <AccordionHeader 
      title="üìÖ Daily Activities" 
      sectionId="dailyActivities" 
      count={dailyPlans.length}
    />
    {isSectionExpanded('dailyActivities') && (
      <View style={styles.accordionContent}>
        {dailyPlans.map((day: any, dayIndex: number) => (
          <View key={dayIndex} style={styles.dayCard}>
            {/* Day header with date */}
            {/* Activities with times, locations, ratings, costs */}
            {/* Meals with restaurants, ratings, locations */}
          </View>
        ))}
      </View>
    )}
  </View>
)}
```

#### Features Displayed
For each day:
- **Day Number & Date**
- **Activities Section**:
  - Activity name
  - Start/end times (‚è∞)
  - Description
  - Location (üìç)
  - Rating with review count (‚≠ê)
  - Estimated cost (üí∞)
- **Meals Section**:
  - Meal name/type (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)
  - Time
  - Restaurant details:
    - Name
    - Description
    - Location
    - Rating with review count
    - Estimated cost

## Files Changed
- `/src/components/ai/AIItineraryDisplay.tsx`
  - **Lines 76-82**: Fixed data extraction (added `itineraryData` variable)
  - **Lines 86-94**: Added comprehensive debug logging
  - **Lines 443-550**: Added complete Daily Activities accordion section
  - Total changes: ~115 lines added/modified

## Verification
- ‚úÖ All 712 tests pass (100% pass rate maintained)
- ‚úÖ Data structure matches OUTPUT.md example
- ‚úÖ PWA parity achieved for both data extraction AND rendering
- ‚úÖ Debug logs confirm correct data extraction:
  ```
  [RN AIItineraryDisplay] itineraryData?.days: 8
  [RN AIItineraryDisplay] itineraryData?.dailyPlans: 8
  [RN AIItineraryDisplay] Final dailyPlans: 8
  [RN AIItineraryDisplay] dailyPlans[0]: {activities: [...], meals: [...]}
  ```

## Sample Data Structure (from OUTPUT.md)
```json
{
  "response": {
    "data": {
      "itinerary": {
        "days": [
          {
            "day": 1,
            "date": "2025-11-06",
            "activities": [
              {
                "name": "Marston House",
                "startTime": "10:00",
                "endTime": "16:00",
                "location": "Marston House",
                "rating": 4.8,
                "userRatingsTotal": 201,
                "phone": "(619) 297-9327",
                "website": "https://...",
                "estimatedCost": {...}
              }
            ],
            "meals": [
              {
                "name": "Dinner",
                "time": "19:00",
                "type": "dinner",
                "restaurant": {
                  "name": "Tom Ham's Lighthouse",
                  "rating": 4.5,
                  "location": {...}
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ],
        "dailyPlans": [...] // Duplicate structure
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Impact
- ‚úÖ Daily activities now display correctly in RN app
- ‚úÖ Matches PWA behavior exactly for both data extraction AND UI
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible with legacy structures
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing tests
- ‚úÖ Rich display with times, locations, ratings, and costs
- ‚úÖ Collapsible accordion matching other sections
