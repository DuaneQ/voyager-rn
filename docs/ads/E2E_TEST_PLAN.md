**Test counts:**
- `voyager-RN`: 2405/2405 passing
- `voyager-ads`: 632/632 passing
- `functions`: 400/400 passing

### What to do first tomorrow morning

1. **Push the two local `voyager-RN` changes** (PromotionCard key prop + AIItineraryDisplay typing):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/icebergslim/projects/voyager-RN && git add -A && git commit -m "fix: remove inner View key prop in PromotionCard; infer PromotionData type in AIItineraryDisplay" && git push origin ads-phase2
   ```

2. **Resume manual E2E testing** — highest priority sections:
   - **Section 3 (Targeting Accuracy)** — all sub-tests pending; requires creating new targeted campaigns in `voyager-ads` portal. Start with 3.1 (age) and 3.2 (gender) since those are simplest to set up.
   - **Section 12 (AI Itinerary Slot)** — entire section untouched; requires at least one `ai_slot` campaign in dev Firestore.
   - **Section 6.2–6.4 (Feed Position edge cases)** — needs a feed with a known video count.

3. **Note on `3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge`** — this campaign's `endDate` was `2026-03-07` (today). As of 2026-03-08 it will be expired and excluded by the server. Update Firestore `endDate` to a future date if you need it for testing, or use a different campaign.

### Campaign inventory (mundo1-dev as of 2026-03-07)

| campaignId | Name | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge` | E2E Video | active | endDate=2026-03-07 — **expired as of 2026-03-08** |
| `L6HQIxUojqfDPcZjtqD4` | Summer Beach Escape | active | budgetCents≈4999 (CPM) |
| `SjgNVINC660UEHjIAqev` | Winter Beach Escape | active | Mux HLS; all 4 quartiles confirmed |
| `Sqcic5yfgxmWZKgP3PRJ` | (unknown) | active | CPC billing; no spend field (expected) |
| `uqRWtMKu2lEWDPnMsCRO` | (unknown) | active | budgetCents restored to 5000 after auto-pause test |
| `TYwLRxdE7jjAAheK07k9` | (unknown) | active | `isUnderReview: true` — never delivered |
| `NZ6hJztKIuzzoyuGqWEh` | Amalfi | active | startDate=2026-03-08 — **becomes eligible 2026-03-08** |
| `kE4B1zQIfjkx0kKV7p6d` | (age targeting test campaign) | active | ageFrom=30 ageTo=44 (last set — outside test user's age 25); reset before section 3 tests |

## How to use this plan

- Run each test case, observe the console logs, and mark `[ ]` → `[x]` when the expected output is confirmed.
- Mark `[!]` for failures with a note explaining what was observed vs. expected.
- Each section maps to a specific layer of the ad pipeline.

---

## 1. Targeting Context — User Profile

> **What to check:** `[AdContext]` logs fire on Video Feed load and contain the correct values for the current test user.

### 1.1 Full profile user (gender + dob + activities + travelStyle all set)

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** Logged in as Support (dob 2001-01-22 → age 25, gender Male, activities [cultural, shopping, food], travelStyle luxury). After `travelProfileLoading` resolved to `false`, all four context fields were correctly populated and logged before the fetch fired.

- [x] `[AdContext] gender:` shows the user's gender — **observed: `"Male"`**
- [x] `[AdContext] age:` shows a positive integer computed from dob — **observed: `25`**
- [x] `[AdContext] activityPreferences:` shows the user's activities array — **observed: `['cultural', 'shopping', 'food']`**
- [x] `[AdContext] travelStyles:` shows the user's travel style — **observed: `['luxury']`**
- [x] `[AdContext] built (travelProfileLoading=false):` shows all four fields — **observed: `{gender: 'Male', age: 25, activityPreferences: Array(3), travelStyles: Array(1)}`; no `NO CONTEXT`**

### 1.2 Partial profile user (no dob, no travel style)

- [ ] `[AdContext] age: dob not set on user profile — age targeting unavailable` is logged
- [ ] `[AdContext] travelStyle: not set in travel profile` is logged
- [ ] `[AdContext] built` still emits `{ gender, activityPreferences }` — context is partial, not absent

### 1.3 Brand-new user (no profile fields set at all)

- [ ] All four "not set" warning lines are logged
- [ ] `[AdContext] built ... NO CONTEXT — ad fetch will score all campaigns equally (score=0)` is logged
- [ ] Ads are still returned and rendered (targeting is soft — score 0, not blocked)

### 1.4 travelProfile loading race (web only)

> **Observed 2026-03-07 (post-fix).** Before the fix two fetches fired: the first with only `{gender, age}` (travel profile not yet loaded), the second with the full context. After adding `if (travelProfileLoading) return` at the top of the fetch effect, only the second fetch fires. The existing `prevTravelLoadingRef` mechanism already triggered the follow-up once loading resolved — no extra logic needed.

- [x] `[AdContext] skipping ad fetch — travelProfile still loading` is logged on initial render — **observed: ✅**
- [x] `[AdContext] built (travelProfileLoading=false)` fires with the full profile once loading resolves — **observed: `{gender: 'Male', age: 25, activityPreferences: Array(3), travelStyles: Array(1)}`**
- [x] Only **one** `[AdDelivery] fetching` call fires per page load — **observed: single fetch with complete context; no premature partial-context fetch**

---

## 2. Ad Delivery — selectAds Response

> **What to check:** `[AdDelivery]` logs confirm the correct ads come back from the Cloud Function.

### 2.1 Ads returned for video_feed

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** 6 campaigns in Firestore; 5 eligible. `TYwLRxdE7jjAAheK07k9` (`isUnderReview: true`) was hard-filtered by the CF and never appeared. `Sqcic5yfgxmWZKgP3PRJ` had no `budgetCents` field directly but `budgetAmount: "50"` → server computed 5000¢ and included it. All 5 campaigns have no demographic targeting set, so all scored equally (+2 for age-in-range); tie-break is alphabetical ascending by `campaignId`.

- [x] `[AdDelivery] fetching placement=video_feed` is logged on feed load — **observed: ✅**
- [x] `[AdDelivery] ✓ 5 ad(s) received from server for placement=video_feed` — **observed: exactly 5**
- [x] Returned array in order: `3jMaSapi → L6HQIxUo → SjgNVINC → Sqcic5yf → uqRWtMKu` — **observed: alphabetical tie-break confirmed ✅**
- [x] `TYwLRxdE7jjAAheK07k9` absent from response — **observed: ✅ (isUnderReview correctly excluded)**

### 2.2 No ads available (e.g. all campaigns paused or budget exhausted)

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** Set `status: "paused"` on all active campaigns in Firestore (note: `muxStatus: "paused"` is a separate Mux field — the campaign-level `status` field must be changed). Reloaded feed — server returned 0 ads. Feed loaded normally with no sponsored cards, no crash.

- [x] `[AdDelivery] ✓ 0 ad(s) received from server for placement=video_feed: []` — **observed: ✅**
- [x] Feed renders normally with no sponsored cards (no crash, no blank slots) — **observed: ✅**

### 2.3 selectAds error (network down / emulator offline)

> **Observed 2026-03-07 (web, Chrome DevTools → Offline).** Going offline while on the video feed and then navigating to another tab triggered a lazy-chunk load failure (`ProfilePage.bundle` could not be fetched). This propagated to the global `ErrorBoundary` and crashed the whole app. **Root cause:** `AppNavigator.web.tsx` Suspense wrappers had no local error boundary — chunk-load failures bubbled to the top.
>
> **Fix applied:** wrapped each lazy `<Suspense>` in `<ErrorBoundary level="page">` in `AppNavigator.web.tsx`. Chunk failures are now caught at the page slot and show an inline "This section encountered an error / Try Again" message — the rest of the app stays alive.
>
> **Re-test after fix:** go offline, navigate to a tab whose chunk is not yet cached → should see page-level error message, not full-app crash. Tab bar and other already-loaded tabs remain usable.

> **Bug 3 observed 2026-03-07:** with only 3 offline video placeholders in the feed, `spliceAdsIntoList` never reached `FIRST_AD_AFTER=3` (the while-loop condition `3 < 3` is false) so the cached ad was silently dropped. **Fix:** trailing-ad fallback in `useAdFrequency.ts` — if no insertion slot was reached but ads are available, append one ad after all content. **Confirmed 2026-03-07 ✅**

- [x] **Bug 1 fixed** — global app crash on offline lazy-chunk load (`AppNavigator.web.tsx`) — **fixed 2026-03-07 ✅**
- [x] **Bug 2 fixed** — stale ad disappeared after navigation while offline — module-level session cache in `useAdDelivery`; `clearAdsCache()` called on sign-out — **fixed 2026-03-07 ✅**
- [x] **Bug 3 fixed** — ad dropped when content count equals `FIRST_AD_AFTER` — trailing-ad fallback in `useAdFrequency.ts` — **fixed 2026-03-07 ✅**
- [x] `[AdDelivery] ✗ fetchAds error (video_feed): ...` logged while offline — **confirmed 2026-03-07 ✅**
- [x] Stale ad from before going offline is **still visible** on return to Videos tab (ad slot rendered, video stalled offline as expected) — **confirmed 2026-03-07 ✅**
- [x] Feed tab bar remains responsive (no full-app crash) — **confirmed 2026-03-07 ✅**

## 3. Targeting Accuracy — Per Dimension

> **Setup:** Use the advertiser portal (`voyager-ads`) to create test campaigns with specific targeting.  
> Switch between test user accounts in voyager-RN to verify inclusion/exclusion.

### 3.1 Age targeting

| Campaign targeting | Test user age | Expected in feed? |
|---|---|---|
| ageFrom=18, ageTo=25 | age 22 | ✅ Yes |
| ageFrom=18, ageTo=25 | age 40 | ❌ No (score 0 on age, may still appear if no other ads) |
| ageFrom=35, ageTo=50 | age 40 | ✅ Yes (scores +2) |
| ageFrom=35, ageTo=50 | age 22 | ❌ No (score 0 on age) |

> **Observed 2026-03-09 — positive case.** Campaign `kE4B1zQIfjkx0kKV7p6d` (`ageFrom=18 ageTo=30`, user age=25 → inside range → +2 score). Appeared at **index 0** ahead of 4 other campaigns scoring 0. `[AdDelivery] ✓ 5 ad(s) received` ✅
>
> **Observed 2026-03-09 — negative case.** Changed to `ageFrom=30 ageTo=44` (user age=25 → outside range → score 0). Campaign tied with all others at 0; alphabetical tie-break placed it 6th. With `limit=5` the server excluded it entirely — not just index 4 but absent from response. `[AdDelivery] ✓ 5 ad(s) received`; order `L6HQ → NZ6h → SjgN → Sqci → uqRW` ✅  Note: `[AdPool] pool refreshed — 5 ad(s); prefetch guard reset` confirmed `useAdPool` is live.

- [x] Age-matched campaign (`kE4B`, ageFrom=18 ageTo=30) appears at **index 0** — **observed: ✅ 2026-03-09**
- [x] Age-mismatched campaign (`kE4B`, ageFrom=30 ageTo=44) drops to last / excluded by limit — **observed: ✅ absent from 5-ad response 2026-03-09**

### 3.2 Gender targeting

| Campaign targetGender | Test user gender | Expected in feed? |
|---|---|---|
| `male` | male | ✅ Yes (scores +1) |
| `male` | female | ❌ Lower ranked (score 0 on gender) |
| `` (no gender filter) | any | ✅ Yes (open targeting) |

> **Observed 2026-03-10 — positive case.** Set `targetGender: "male"` on `kE4B1zQIfjkx0kKV7p6d` (also `ageFrom=18 ageTo=30`). Test user: Male age 25 → score=3 (+2 age +1 gender). Campaign at **index 0** in 5-ad response. All others scored +2 (age only) or 0. Impression flushed `processed=1 skipped=0`. Portal Mar 10: Male age 18–30 = 1 impression ✅
>
> **Observed 2026-03-10 — negative case.** Set `targetGender: "female"` — user is Male → gender bonus lost → kE4B score drops from 3 → 2 (age only). All other campaigns score 0 (no targeting). Response order: `kE4B → SjgNVINC → Sqcic5yf → L6HQIxUo → NZ6hJzt`. kE4B **remains at index 0** — correct, because score 2 still beats score 0. Gender is a **soft ranking signal, not a hard exclusion filter**. To observe a rank drop, a competing campaign must also score ≥ 2. `[AdCard] mounted campaignId=kE4B` confirmed at first slot. Impression + Q25 flushed `processed=1 skipped=0`. ✅

- [x] Gender-matched campaign (`targetGender=male`, user=Male) ranks above gender-mismatched campaigns — **observed: ✅ index 0, score=3 vs others score=2 (2026-03-10)**
- [x] Negative case: set `targetGender: "female"` — kE4B score drops 3→2; still index 0 because all others score 0 (age targeting still dominates). Gender is soft signal — **observed: ✅ correct behaviour confirmed (2026-03-10)**
- [x] Campaign with no `targetGender` set is still eligible for all users — **observed: ✅ SjgNVINC, Sqcic5yf, L6HQIxUo, NZ6hJzt (no gender targeting) all returned in every response (2026-03-10)**

### 3.3 Activity preference targeting

> **Verified 2026-03-10 via integration test** (`selectAds.aiSlot.real.test.ts`). Seeds a `targetActivityPreferences: ['cultural','food']` signal campaign + blank. Positive: `activityPreferences: ['cultural','food']` → signal at lower index (higher rank). Negative: `['hiking','adventure']` → both present, no rank assertion (both score 0, hash-ordered). 14/14 passing.

- [x] Activity overlap ranks signal above blank — **verified: ✅ integration test (2026-03-10)**
- [x] No overlap: campaign still returned (soft scoring, not excluded) — **verified: ✅**
- [x] `[AdContext]` activityPreferences matches user profile — **verified: ✅ manual 2026-03-07**

### 3.4 Travel style targeting

> **Verified 2026-03-10 via integration test** (`selectAds.aiSlot.real.test.ts`). Seeds `targetTravelStyles: ['luxury']` signal + blank. Positive: `travelStyles: ['luxury']` → signal ranked higher. Negative: `['budget']` → both present. 14/14 passing.

- [x] Style overlap (+1) ranks signal above blank — **verified: ✅ integration test (2026-03-10)**
- [x] Mismatched style: campaign still returned, not excluded — **verified: ✅**

### 3.5 Destination targeting (AI slot)

> **Verified 2026-03-10 via integration test** (`selectAds.aiSlot.real.test.ts`). Seeds `targetDestination: 'Paris'` signal + blank. Positive: destination=Paris → signal ranked higher (+2). Negative: different destination → signal does not outrank blank (score 0 vs 0). Partial match (city substring) also scores. 14/14 passing.

- [x] Matching destination (+2) ranks signal above blank — **verified: ✅ integration test (2026-03-10)**
- [x] Non-matching destination: signal does not outrank blank — **verified: ✅**
- [x] Partial city substring match still scores — **verified: ✅**

### 3.6 Travel date overlap targeting

> **Verified 2026-03-10 via integration test** (`selectAds.aiSlot.real.test.ts`). Seeds overlap campaign (dates covering user trip) + noOverlap campaign (dates outside trip) + blank. Positive: overlapping dates → overlap campaign ranked above blank (+2). Negative: noOverlap scores 0 — present but not ranked above blank. Eligibility: campaign with target dates still returned when user has no dates. 14/14 passing.

- [x] Overlapping dates (+2) ranks campaign above blank — **verified: ✅ integration test (2026-03-10)**
- [x] Non-overlapping dates: campaign still returned (no hard exclusion) — **verified: ✅**
- [x] Campaign with target dates returned when user has no dates — **verified: ✅**

---

## 4. Ranking / Score Validation

> **Goal:** Confirm that campaigns with more matching targeting dimensions rank higher in the returned array.

### 4.1 Age targeting — positive match ranks campaign first

> **Observed 2026-03-07 (positive case).** Created campaign `kE4B1zQIfjkx0kKV7p6d` (Male age 18–30) with `ageFrom: "18"`, `ageTo: "34"`. Test user is age 25 → scores +2 for age match. Campaign appeared at **index 0** in the 4-ad response, ahead of all other campaigns which had no age targeting (score 0). Firestore `daily_metrics` 2026-03-07 updated: `impressions: 2, spend: 2, q25/50/75/100: 1` confirming delivery. ✅
>
> **Observed 2026-03-07 (negative case).** Changed `ageFrom: "30"`, `ageTo: "44"` — age 25 now outside range → score drops to 0. Campaign fell to **index 3** (last position); order became `L6HQIxUo → SjgNVINC → Sqcic5yf → kE4B1zQI` (pure alphabetical, all score 0). ✅

- [x] Age-matched campaign appears at index 0 in response — **observed: ✅ (`kE4B1zQIfjkx0kKV7p6d` at index 0 with ageFrom=18 ageTo=34, user age=25)**
- [x] Negative case: `ageFrom: "30"` ageTo=44 — campaign drops to index 3 (last) — **observed: ✅**

### 4.2 Seen campaign penalty

> **Verified 2026-03-10 via integration test** (`selectAds.real.test.ts:930`). Test seeds a "seen" campaign and a fresh peer with identical targeting, calls the live `selectAds` CF with `seenCampaignIds: [seenId]`, and asserts the seen campaign ranks below the fresh one (-5 penalty). Passed in 623ms against `mundo1-dev`. Manual E2E skipped — requires 22+ videos to hit the 80% pool threshold in the browser; the integration test provides equivalent coverage.

- [x] Seen campaign (-5 penalty) ranks below identically-targeted fresh campaign — **verified: ✅ integration test passed live (2026-03-10)**
- [x] `seenCampaignIds` forwarded correctly in payload — **verified: ✅ `useAdDelivery.test.ts:272` unit test + integration test confirming server applies penalty**

### 4.3 Tie-break is per-user deterministic (FNV-1a)

> **Observed 2026-03-07 (pre-tieBreakKey).** Alphabetical tie-break: `3jMaSapi → L6HQIxUo → SjgNVINC → Sqcic5yf → uqRWtMKu` — same order across all users.
>
> **Updated 2026-03-10 (tieBreakKey deployed).** Alphabetical tie-break replaced with FNV-1a hash seeded by `userId + '|' + today`. 2026-03-10 response for test user `I8EPpdX...`: tied campaigns order `kE4B → SjgNVINC → Sqcic5yf → L6HQIxUo → NZ6hJzt` — **different** from former alphabetical order, confirming hash is active. Order is stable across multiple fetches within the same session (same seed). Deployed to dev + prod 2026-03-10. 86/86 unit tests passing.

- [x] Same campaign order across both fetches in the session — **observed: ✅ deterministic within a session**
- [x] Order differs from alphabetical — **observed: ✅ FNV-1a hash active (2026-03-10)**

---

## 5. Ad Expiry — Server + Client Guard

### 5.1 Server-side: expired campaign never returned

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** Set `endDate: "2026-03-06"` on `3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge` in Firestore, then reloaded the feed. Server returned 4 ads instead of 5; `3jMaSapi` was absent. Remaining 4 in correct alphabetical order: `L6HQIxUo → SjgNVINC → Sqcic5yf → uqRWtMKu`. First mounted ad was `L6HQIxUojqfDPcZjtqD4` (Summer Beach Escape). Impression tracked and flushed for the new first ad.

- [x] `[AdDelivery] ✓ 4 ad(s) received` — **observed: ✅ (5 → 4 after expiry)**
- [x] `3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge` absent from response — **observed: ✅**
- [x] Feed renders normally with 4 ads, no crash — **observed: ✅**

### 5.2 Server-side: not-yet-started campaign never returned

> **Observed 2026-03-07 (incidental).** Created campaign `NZ6hJztKIuzzoyuGqWEh` ("Amalfi") with `startDate: "2026-03-08"` (tomorrow), `status: "active"`, `isUnderReview: false`, `muxStatus: "ready"`. Feed returned 0 ads — Amalfi absent despite being otherwise eligible. Server date filter correctly excluded it.

- [x] Campaign with `startDate` set to tomorrow does not appear in `[AdDelivery]` response — **observed: ✅ (`NZ6hJztKIuzzoyuGqWEh` absent; `[AdDelivery] ✓ 0 ad(s) received`)**

### 5.3 Client-side expiry guard (midnight boundary simulation)

> **Note 2026-03-07.** The full-reload test above (5.1) had the server filter the expired campaign before the client guard could run. The client guard (`filterExpiredAds()` in `useAdDelivery`) is a belt-and-suspenders protection for the case where the app is already open with a cached ad that crosses midnight. To isolate the client path: load the feed (ads cached in state), set `endDate` to yesterday in Firestore, then trigger a re-render without a new fetch (e.g. background/foreground the app without a full reload).

- [ ] With ads already cached in state, trigger re-render after `endDate` has passed
- [ ] `[AdDelivery] ⚠ CLIENT EXPIRY GUARD: ad expired — filtered out campaignId=... endDate=... today=...` is logged
- [ ] The stale ad is **not rendered** in the feed

### 5.4 Client-side guard: not-yet-started ad filtered

- [ ] Manually inject an `AdUnit` with `startDate: '2026-03-08'` (tomorrow)
- [ ] `[AdDelivery] ⚠ CLIENT EXPIRY GUARD: ad not yet started — filtered out` is logged
- [ ] That ad is not rendered

### 5.5 Ads without dates pass the guard (backward-compat)

- [ ] `AdUnit` with no `startDate` / `endDate` — **not** filtered out
- [ ] Feed renders as normal

---

## 6. Feed Position — Ad Slot Placement

> **Constants:** `FIRST_AD_AFTER = 3` → first ad at content index 3 (4th video, mixed-feed slot 4).  
> `AD_INTERVAL = 5` → next ad every 5 content items.

### 6.1 First ad at correct position

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** Ad appeared in the 5th slot. With `FIRST_AD_AFTER=3`, the first ad is inserted at mixed-feed index 4 (0-based), which is the 5th item (1-based). Confirmed correct.

- [x] Ad appeared in the 5th feed slot — **observed: ✅ (index 4, after 4 organic videos)**
- [x] `[AdCard] mounted campaignId=3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge` fired at that position — **observed: ✅**

### 6.2 Subsequent ad interval

- [ ] Continue scrolling — next ad appears at mixed-feed position 10 (after 5 more videos)
- [ ] Then position 16, 22, … (every 5 content items)
- [ ] `[AdCard] mounted` logs confirm each sponsored card mount

### 6.3 Fewer videos than FIRST_AD_AFTER (edge case)

- [ ] Feed with only 3 videos — no ad is rendered (content list too short to reach slot index 3)
- [ ] No `[AdCard] mounted` log
- [ ] No crash or blank slot

### 6.4 Ad cycling when more slots than ads

- [ ] Feed has 20 videos and only 1 ad
- [ ] All 4 ad slots (positions 4, 9, 14, 19) render the **same** campaign (cycling)
- [ ] `[AdCard] mounted campaignId=X` appears 4 times with the same `campaignId`

---

## 7. Impression Tracking

### 7.1 Impression fires on visibility

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** Confirmed for both `3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge` (E2E Video, creativeType=video) and `L6HQIxUojqfDPcZjtqD4` (Summer Beach Escape). Each fired exactly once when the card became active (`isActive=true`).

- [x] `[AdImpression] queued campaignId=3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge placement=video_feed` — **observed: ✅**
- [x] `[AdImpression] queued campaignId=L6HQIxUojqfDPcZjtqD4 placement=video_feed` — **observed: ✅**
- [x] `[AdTracking] impression queued campaignId=X` logged for each — **observed: ✅**

### 7.2 Impression is deduplicated within session

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** Campaign `3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge` (E2E Video). Scrolled away and back. Note: `[AdImpression] queued` fired a second time from `SponsoredVideoCard` because the virtualized list destroys and recreates the component on scroll — this is expected. However, `useAdTracking` correctly absorbed it: `impression deduped (already tracked)` was logged and **no second flush** was sent to the server. The dedup key lives in the tracking hook, not the component.

- [x] `[AdImpression] queued` fires on second mount — **observed: expected (component remount)**
- [x] `[AdTracking] impression deduped (already tracked) campaignId=3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge` — **observed: ✅**
- [x] No second `[AdTracking] flushing` for the duplicate — **observed: ✅ (no second server call)**

### 7.3 Impression flushes to server

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** Both impression events flushed independently within the 10s flush interval. `logAdEvents` CF returned `processed=1 skipped=0` for each. No `AbortError` noise in the logs (Issue 3 fix confirmed).

- [x] `[AdTracking] flushing 1 event(s) — impressions=1 clicks=0 quartiles=0 campaignIds=[3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge]` — **observed: ✅**
- [x] `[AdTracking] flushing 1 event(s) — impressions=1 clicks=0 quartiles=0 campaignIds=[L6HQIxUojqfDPcZjtqD4]` — **observed: ✅**
- [x] `[AdTracking] ✓ flush complete processed=1 skipped=0` for both — **observed: ✅**
- [x] Firestore `ads_campaigns/3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge/daily_metrics/2026-03-07.impressions = 3` — **observed: ✅ matches total flushes across today's sessions**
- [x] Portal chart Mar 7 tooltip: E2E Video = 3 impressions — **observed: ✅ matches Firestore exactly**

---

## 8. Click Tracking

### 8.1 CTA tap fires click and opens URL

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** Tapped the CTA on `3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge` (E2E Video, CTA URL = `https://travalpass.com`). Click fired immediately and was queued for flush.

- [x] `[AdClick] CTA tapped campaignId=3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge url=https://travalpass.com` — **observed: ✅**
- [x] `[AdTracking] click queued campaignId=3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge` — **observed: ✅**
- [ ] Landing URL opens in device browser / in-app browser — **not verified in this session (iOS simulator)**

### 8.2 Click flushes to server

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** Click flushed immediately after CTA tap (within the 10s interval). Server confirmed `processed=1 skipped=0`.

- [x] `[AdTracking] flushing 1 event(s) — impressions=0 clicks=1 quartiles=0 campaignIds=[3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge]` — **observed: ✅**
- [x] `[AdTracking] ✓ flush complete processed=1 skipped=0` — **observed: ✅**
- [x] Firestore `ads_campaigns/3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge/daily_metrics/2026-03-07.clicks: 1` — **observed: ✅ (visible in Firestore screenshot)**

### 8.3 CPC campaign: budget decrements on click

- [ ] Create a CPC campaign with budget $5.00 (`budgetCents=500`)
- [ ] Tap CTA — after flush, check Firestore: `budgetCents` decremented by the CPC rate
- [ ] Campaign remains `active` while budget > 0

## 9. Video Quartile Tracking

### 9.1 25% milestone fires

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** Campaign `L6HQIxUojqfDPcZjtqD4` (Summer Beach Escape, duration 45.9s). 25% fired at `time=12.0s` (45.9 × 0.25 = 11.5s — within the 500ms polling window ✅). Quartile event flushed and confirmed processed.

- [x] `[AdQuartile] 25% reached campaignId=L6HQIxUojqfDPcZjtqD4 time=12.0s duration=45.9s` — **observed: ✅**
- [x] `[AdTracking] quartile=25% queued campaignId=L6HQIxUojqfDPcZjtqD4` — **observed: ✅**
- [x] `[AdTracking] flushing 1 event(s) — impressions=0 clicks=0 quartiles=1` + `processed=1 skipped=0` — **observed: ✅**

### 9.2 Quartiles fire in order and only once

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** Confirmed for `3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge` (E2E Video, duration 28.3s). Q25 at 7.5s, Q50 at 14.5s, Q75 at 21.5s, Q100 at 27.5s (28.3 × 0.97 = 27.45s ✅) — all accurate within the 500ms polling window. Q75+Q100 batched into a single flush (`flushing 2 event(s) — quartiles=2 processed=2 skipped=0`). Q100 required a fix (see Q100 item). Firestore `daily_metrics/2026-03-07` final: `impressions=6, clicks=1, spend=6, q25=4, q50=4, q75=4, q100=1` — all match.

- [x] `[AdQuartile] 25% reached campaignId=3jMaSapi time=7.5s duration=28.3s` (28.3 × 0.25 = 7.075s ✅) — **observed: ✅**
- [x] `[AdQuartile] 50% reached campaignId=3jMaSapi time=14.5s duration=28.3s` (28.3 × 0.5 = 14.15s ✅) — **observed: ✅**
- [x] `[AdQuartile] 75% reached campaignId=3jMaSapi time=21.5s duration=28.3s` (28.3 × 0.75 = 21.2s ✅) — **observed: ✅**
- [x] Q50+Q75 batched: `flushing 2 event(s) — quartiles=2 processed=2 skipped=0` — **observed: ✅**
- [!] `[AdQuartile] 100% reached` — **BUG FOUND + FIXED 2026-03-07:** `pct >= 100` was never satisfied because the looping video resets `currentTime` to 0 before the 500ms poll fires. Firestore confirmed `q100` field absent despite 3 full loops. **Fix applied:** `effectivePct(100) = 97` in `SponsoredVideoCard.tsx` — the 100 milestone now triggers at 97% completion, which the poll catches reliably. TS clean, 24/24 tests pass.
- [x] Q100 fires after fix: `[AdQuartile] 100% reached campaignId=3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge time=27.5s duration=28.3s` — **observed: ✅ (27.5 / 28.3 = 97.2% ✅)**
- [x] Firestore `videoQuartiles.q100: 1` written — **observed: ✅**
- [x] Q75+Q100 batched: `flushing 2 event(s) — quartiles=2 processed=2 skipped=0` — **observed: ✅**
- [ ] No duplicate quartile logs on replay (loop) — **pending: `quartilesFiredRef` resets on component remount (by design); dedup within a single mount not yet explicitly tested**

### 9.3 Quartiles do not fire for inactive card

> **Additional observation 2026-03-07.** `SjgNVINC660UEHjIAqev` (Winter Beach Escape — Mux HLS video, duration 17.5s) confirmed all 4 quartiles in same session: Q25@4.5s, Q50@9.0s, Q75@13.5s, Q100@17.0s (17.5×0.97=16.975s ✅). Validates Q100 fix works on Mux-streamed content. Q75+Q100 batched (`quartiles=2 processed=2 skipped=0`).

- [ ] Ad card scrolled off screen (`isActive=false`) — no quartile polling
- [ ] No `[AdQuartile]` logs while card is inactive

## 10. CPM Campaign: Budget & Auto-Pause

### 10.1 Budget decrements on impression (CPM)

> **Observed 2026-03-07 (implicit — E2E Video campaign).** `3jMaSapi1T2EsTuFioge` is CPM, `budgetAmount: "100"` → 10,000¢ starting budget. Portal shows 20 all-time impressions. Firestore shows `budgetCents: 9980` — exactly 10,000 − 20 = 9,980¢ (20 × $0.01 at $10 CPM). `daily_metrics/2026-03-07.spend: 3` = 3¢ for today's 3 impressions. Math checks out end-to-end.

- [x] CPM campaign budget decrements on impression flush — **observed: 20 impressions → budgetCents dropped from 10000 to 9980 (−20¢) ✅**
- [x] `daily_metrics.spend` reflects today's cost — **observed: spend=3 for 3 impressions today ✅**
- [x] `L6HQIxUojqfDPcZjtqD4` budget math: `budgetCents: 4999` after 4 impressions (5000−20¢×1 = 4999¢ ✅ at same $10 CPM rate) — **observed: ✅**
- [ ] Campaign auto-pauses when `budgetCents` reaches 0 — **in progress: `uqRWtMKu` set to budgetCents=1; awaiting impression flush**

### 10.2 Campaign auto-pauses when budget exhausted

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** Set `uqRWtMKu2lEWDPnMsCRO` to `budgetCents: 0` and `status: "paused"` in Firestore (simulating what `logAdEvents` writes when it decrements to zero). Reloaded feed — response showed exactly 3 ads (`L6HQIxUo → SjgNVINC → Sqcic5yf`); `uqRWtMKu` absent. CF hard-filter on `status != 'active'` confirmed working. Campaign restored to `status: "active", budgetCents: 5000` after test.

- [x] Firestore `status: "paused"` campaign absent from `selectAds` response — **observed: ✅ (4 → 3 ads)**
- [x] `[AdDelivery] ✓ 3 ad(s) received` — **observed: ✅**
- [x] Feed renders normally with remaining ads, no crash — **observed: ✅**

---

## 11. Admin Approval Gate

### 11.1 Pending-review campaign is never delivered

> **Observed 2026-03-07 (implicit).** `TYwLRxdE7jjAAheK07k9` (Summer Beach Escape — test campaign edited) had `isUnderReview: true` in Firestore. It never appeared in the `selectAds` response across any fetch during this session — confirming the server-side hard filter is working.

- [x] `selectAds` query only returns campaigns with `status == 'active'` AND `isUnderReview == false` — **observed: ✅ `TYwLRxdE` absent from all responses**
- [ ] Create a brand-new campaign in `voyager-ads` (status = `pending_review`) and verify it does not appear — **pending dedicated test**

### 11.2 Rejected campaign is never delivered

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** Set `SjgNVINC660UEHjIAqev.isUnderReview: true` directly in Firestore. Reloaded feed — response dropped from 3 → 2 ads (`L6HQIxUo`, `Sqcic5yf`); `SjgNVINC` absent. `[AdDelivery] ✓ 2 ad(s) received` confirmed in console. Also noted: `Sqcic5` daily_metrics has no `spend` field — correct because it is `billingModel: "cpc"` (budget only decrements on clicks, not impressions).

- [x] Set `isUnderReview: true` on a live campaign — **observed: ✅**
- [x] Reload feed — campaign absent from response — **observed: ✅ (3→2 ads)**
- [x] `[AdDelivery]` log shows correct reduced count — **observed: ✅**

### 11.3 Approved campaign reappears after review cleared

> **Observed 2026-03-07.** Set `SjgNVINC660UEHjIAqev.isUnderReview: false` in Firestore. Reloaded feed — response returned 3 ads (`L6HQIxUo → SjgNVINC → Sqcic5yf`). `[AdCard] mounted campaignId=SjgNVINC660UEHjIAqev` confirmed in console. All 4 quartiles (Q25 Q50 Q75 Q100) fired for SjgNVINC; Firestore daily_metrics 2026-03-07 updated to `impressions: 3, spend: 3, q25/50/75/100: 3`.

- [x] Set `isUnderReview: false` — **observed: ✅**
- [x] Reload feed — campaign reappears in response (2→3 ads) — **observed: ✅**
- [x] `[AdCard] mounted campaignId=SjgNVINC` confirmed — **observed: ✅**
- [x] Firestore daily_metrics updated with new impression + quartiles — **observed: ✅**

## 12. AI Itinerary Slot

### 12.1 Promotion slot fires for ai_slot placement

> **Observed 2026-03-09.** Opened AI-generated itinerary (Paris). `[AdDelivery] fetching placement=ai_slot limit=3` fired immediately with destination context. Two ads returned and rendered as `PromotionCard` — `YWazKsM899kFOlXWHOBm` (LosAngeles) and `bElukm9JuyC2Np49iVSo` (Cultural+Food&Dining). Impression logged and flushed within 10 s. CTA tap fired click event and flushed `processed=1 skipped=0`. Firestore `daily_metrics/2026-03-09` for both campaigns updated with `impressions: 1, clicks: 1`. ✅

- [x] `[AdDelivery] fetching placement=ai_slot` is logged with destination context — **observed: ✅**
- [x] Promotion card renders with `businessName` visible — **observed: ✅ (both cards rendered correctly)**
- [x] `[AdTracking] flushing` impression + click for ai_slot campaign — **observed: ✅**
- [x] Firestore `daily_metrics/2026-03-09.impressions/clicks` incremented — **observed: ✅**

### 12.2 No crash when ai_slot returns no ads

> **Observed 2026-03-10.** Paused both `ai_slot` campaigns (`YWazKsM899kFOlXWHOBm` and `bElukm9JuyC2Np49iVSo`) in Firestore. Opened AI itinerary (Los Angeles, Mar 15–22). `[AdDelivery] fetching placement=ai_slot limit=3` fired with full context (destination, dates, gender=Male, age=25). Server returned `[]`. Itinerary loaded fully — Flight Options (12), Accommodation (10), Daily Activities (8) all rendered. No `PromotionCard`, no crash, no blank section. Also confirmed `seenCampaignIds: [kE4B1zQIfjkx0kKV7p6d, SjgNVINC660UEHjIAqev]` correctly forwarded (carried over from video feed session). ✅

- [x] `[AdDelivery] fetching placement=ai_slot` fires with destination context — **observed: ✅**
- [x] `[AdDelivery] ✓ 0 ad(s) received … placement=ai_slot: []` — **observed: ✅**
- [x] No `PromotionCard` rendered — **observed: ✅ itinerary loads cleanly**
- [x] No crash, no blank section — **observed: ✅**

## 13. Edge Cases & Error Resilience

- [ ] **No internet:** `[AdDelivery] ✗ fetchAds error` is logged; feed renders organic videos normally
- [ ] **User not logged in (anonymous):** ads still returned (`selectAds` requires no auth); targeting context is empty (score=0 for all)
- [ ] **Campaign with no creative:** filtered server-side (`!assetUrl && !muxPlaybackUrl` check); never reaches client
- [ ] **Campaign with malformed `endDate`:** `parseDateToNoonUTC` returns `null` on server; date range check skipped; campaign still eligible (soft fail open)
- [ ] **Very long feed (50+ videos):** ad slots at 4, 9, 14, 19, 24 … all render without memory or layout issues
- [ ] **Rapid tab switching:** `useFocusEffect` cleanup stops playback; no orphaned audio from ad video on unfocus
